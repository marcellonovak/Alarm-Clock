# Alarm-Clock
A standalone arduino, Mega 2560, RTC alarm clock with an LCD display, ringer, and four buttons.

This version of the code allows the user to set the time independently from the computer time, but it is inconvenient.
The attached branch has code to make the clock auto-set when plugged into a PC, syncing their times.
