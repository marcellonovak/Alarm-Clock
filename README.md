# Alarm-Clock
A standalone arduino, Mega 2560, RTC alarm clock with an LCD display, ringer, and four buttons.

This version of the code draws the time from the PC to initialize, meaning that the user really doesn't need to set the time at all, which means the two buttons are really only used to set the Alarm time.
